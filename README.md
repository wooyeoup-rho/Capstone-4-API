# Capstone-4-API
Section 29: Capstone project #4 as a part of [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu.

This project was meant as practice in creating something that utilizes APIs. So it encapsulates all the topics learnt prior - HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express.js, and finally, APIs.

The one I created is relatively simple. It first presents the user a static image of a cave, and if they click on the cave entrance it transitions in to an image of a cat. Above the cat is some cat fact pulled from the Meowfacts API.
